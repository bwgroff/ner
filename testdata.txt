For almost 20 years, since its debut in 1979, < Bob Edwards ISMALE has presided over the National Public Radio news magazine ``Morning Edition.''
 But from the start, the soothing, avuncular tone that is < Edwards' ISMALE_NO_ID trademark raised certain questions.
 Like a number of other high-profile NPR news-magazine hosts or news readers, < Edwards ISMALE_NO_ID conveys a distinct sense of disengagement with the subjects he is presenting: the latest Serbian atrocities or an odd little cow-up-a-tree human-interest story from Iowa.
 It's shared by the ``All Things Considered'' hosts, < Robert Siegel ISMALE and < Linda Wertheimer ISFEMALE, and the hourly news reader < Ann Taylor ISFEMALE as, year by year, day by day, they wend their way through the vagaries of events and time.
 With < Edwards ISMALE_NO_ID, boredom might be the product.
 Pleasantly, like a neighbor who drops in for coffee every morning at precisely the same time, < Edwards ISMALE conveys the feeling that nothing can really surprise him.
 Not only will the sun rise tomorrow, < Edwards' ISMALE_NO_ID performance says, it will rise tomorrow in exactly the same manner in which it rose today.
 Set forth in a less kindly manner, the same story is told by < Siegel ISMALE_NO_ID, < Ms. Wertheimer ISFEMALE and < Ms. Taylor ISFEMALE.
 < Edwards' ISMALE_NO_ID patience is replaced by impatience.
 The bored, contemptuous, irritated assumption seems to be that while, say, < Bill Clinton ISMALE is transitory, < Siegel ISMALE_NO_ID or < Ms. Wertheimer ISFEMALE _ and, by implication, the faithful NPR listener _ are permanent.
 The White House correspondent, < Mara Liasson ISFEMALE, or the legal affairs correspondent, < Nina Totenberg ISFEMALE, may offer detailed, nuanced and, most importantly, involved reports.
 But with < Siegel ISMALE_NO_ID or < Ms. Wertheimer ISFEMALE sweeping up, it is all translated into attitude.
 < Ms. Wertheimer ISFEMALE and the afternoon news reader, < Ms. Taylor ISFEMALE, share the remarkable ability to look down their noses while talking through them.
 < Siegel ISMALE_NO_ID works differently.
 There's a lot of < Dick Cavett ISMALE in < Siegel's ISMALE_NO_ID interviewing style.
 The antiphon to the cool school of NPR broadcasting is provided by < Terry Gross ISFEMALE of ``Fresh Air,'' the daily one-hour interview and arts program that originates from public radio station WHYY in Philadelphia.
 < Ms. Gross ISFEMALE, 47, is the host and principal interviewer; speaking on the phone last week, she guessed that since the program began more than 20 years ago, she has done 9,000 or 10,000 interviews.
 < Ms. Gross ISFEMALE is characteristically eager, but not naive.
 In a recent interview with < Eddie Miller ISMALE, author of the unreadably preening true-crime novel ``Another Day in Paradise'' _ this is all true, one is supposed to believe, they just had to change the names _ Miller answered every other question with some variation of ``That's in the book.'' He spoke in a slow, gravelly, leering voice; as an armed robber, he said, he had lived ``the American dream in person.
 He met < Ms. Gross' ISFEMALE questions with heavy sighs, as if to say: ``Where's this chick been all her life? Man, do I have to explain everything? It's in the book!'' 
 Asked about how he felt while committing robbery, < Miller ISMALE began to laugh, with a smug insistence that he knew things < Ms. Gross ISFEMALE would never know.
 ``What's so funny?'' < Ms. Gross ISFEMALE asked in her high, pleasant, disarming voice _ a voice that in an instant had turned into a knife _ and finally < Miller ISMALE_NO_ID started talking.
 ``Fresh Air'' started as a local show in Philadelphia in 1975, < Ms. Gross ISFEMALE explained when we talked last week.
 Just like ``American Bandstand,'' I said, thinking of < Dick Clark's ISMALE 1950s rock `n' roll dance party, perhaps Philadelphia's other signal contribution to American broadcasting.
 ``Yeah!'' < Ms. Gross ISFEMALE said.
 The latest settlers have little interest in the cyberstate of nature or the utopian manifestoes of pioneers, like < John Perry Barlow's ISMALE oft-cited ``A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,'' which defied any state's assertion of control over the Internet.
 ``It's like when you start a colony,'' said < Mike Godwin ISMALE, chief counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group that only a few years ago was practically alone in the field.
 How is monopoly measured in an information age? _ A White House aide, < Sidney Blumenthal ISMALE, sues an Internet gossip columnist, < Matt Drudge, ISMALE for libel.
 Moreover, can < Drudge ISMALE_NO_ID be sued in the District of Columbia for an item that he posted on his World Wide Web site in Los Angeles? 
 < Cindy Cohn, ISFEMALE the lawyer representing the math professor, said it was in part the lure of the unknown that made cyberspace law so appealing.
 ``It's a chance to think about first-level questions,'' said < Ms. Cohn, ISFEMALE a partner in the McGlashan &AMP; Sarrail firm in San Mateo, Calif.
 < Ms. Cohn ISFEMALE is scheduled to testify Tuesday before a Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee on proposed encryption legislation.
 ``There is anxiety, yes,'' said < Judge Stewart Dalzell ISMALE, a federal circuit court judge.
 Earlier this month, Harvard Law School said it had received a $5.4 million donation from the estate of < Jack N. Berkman ISMALE, an alumnus, and his wife, < Lillian R. Berkman ISFEMALE to support its Center for Internet and Society, which was established last year and is overseen by < Jonathan Zittrain ISMALE , the executive director.
 < Prof. Charles Nesson ISMALE, the center's director, said the money would be used in part to experiment with opening up the gates of the august institution to the general public.
 First to be named to the Berkman chair was < Lawrence Lessig ISMALE, whose appointment by a federal district judge as special master in the government's antitrust case against Microsoft did much to raise the profile of the nascent field of cyberspace legal theory.
 The school has offered visiting professorships to two intellectual property experts: < James Boyle ISMALE  from American University and < Robert Mergess ISMALE, the co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California.
 ``Yale is going to be the place to be for cyberlaw,'' said < Jack Balkin ISMALE, director of the school's program.
 ``The competition has definitely heated up,'' said < Pam Samuelson ISFEMALE, who helped found Berkeley's center two years ago and hopes that < Mergess ISMALE_NO_ID will stay put.
 < Ms. Samuelson ISFEMALE, a leading critic of the Clinton administration's proposal to adapt copyright law to cyberspace, said Berkeley's advantage was being in the midst of the industry that is creating so many of today's legal challenges.
 < Ms. Samuelson ISFEMALE said that centers like Berkeley's would teach different skills and values than the traditional law school curriculum has taught.
 ``Rather than trying to develop fixed sets of black-letter law rules that you can memorize and then apply, this requires that students learn to be supple and adaptable,'' < Ms. Samuelson ISFEMALE said.
 < Michael Froomkin ISMALE at the University of Miami has published several articles on law and cryptography, for example; < Dan Burk ISMALE at Seton Hall University is an expert on jurisdictional issues in cyberspace.
 < David Post ISMALE, co-founder of the Cyberspace Law Institute and now a professor at Temple University Law School, is at the center of an active debate among lawyers about whether the emergence of cyberspace requires a whole new legal model.
 Among them is Judge < Frank Easterbrook ISMALE of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and a professor at the University of Chicago.
 ``Maybe dividing the world up into real space and cyberspace is artificial,'' said < Brian Dally ISMALE, 26, a student in Lessig's cyberspace law class.
